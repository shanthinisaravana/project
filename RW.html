		<h3 class="margin"><p>Hi there world!<br><br>Another beautiful day and another new bunch of problems to face. Eh, who doesn’t have problems in this world? Everybody does.<br><br>But that isn’t going to stop real talent from popping out. So let’s get started, shall we?</h3><p>

		<h2>How I became a writer?</h2>

		<h3><p>Simple. By writing. Literally, that’s all it takes.<br><br>And as I said, I did have problems and there were things to stop me from writing. But I didn’t give up. Can I tell you a funny fact? I’ll tell you anyway. No one knew that I’m a writer. Even it took me 17 years to discover what my passion is.<br><br>My parents at first thought it was a waste of time and as typical Indian parents it’s normal for every parent to think that way. They told me not to waste my time and concentrate on my Engineering degree. Yes, you heard right. I’m studying Engineering. Please don’t ask if it was by choice or forced by parents. It’s complicated.<br><br>And secondly, this Engineering does consume a lot of my time which gives me very less time to concentrate on my writing. <br><br>To be honest, I can continue writing for hours but I can’t study Engineering for more than an hour without yawning.<br>As the saying goes, time is a created thing. To say “I don’t have time” is to say “I don’t want to”.<br><br>Thirdly, my insecurities. Come on, we’re humans. We all have insecurities and fears and whatnot. It’s okay. But what’s not okay is to just deem ourselves not worthy.<br><br>Your language is not good? That’s okay, you can develop. You don’t have enough equipment? That’s okay, nowadays you can even write on your mobile phones. <br><br>To say in short, You want to be a writer? Then be a writer no matter what degree you have. Engineering or tech or literature or whatever. It doesn’t matter.<br><br>Writing and interest in writing is all it takes to become a writer.</p></h3>
